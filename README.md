# spring-angular
Building a multi-module maven project having both spring and angular modules

The angular module contains the UI for the project and is configured to be packaged to be included in the webapp module

The spring module contains the API for the project and is configured to be executable(run independently) or included in the webapp module

The webapp module generates a runnable jar that provides both the UI and the API
